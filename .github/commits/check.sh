$failed of $checked commit messages have the wrong format.

Use [TAG]: message

  DEV        new feature, new endpoint, new code
  BUGFIX     a fix for something that was broken
  REFACTO    moving or rewriting code without changing behaviour
  DOC        documentation only
  TEST       tests only
  CI         workflows and build tooling
  PERF       speed or footprint
  SECURITY   hardening, closing a leak
  BREAKING   breaks the contract or a published API
  REVERT     undoing an earlier commit
  CHORE      dependencies and other housekeeping

Tags are uppercase and in brackets. Keep the message in the imperative, drop
the trailing period, and stay under $SUBJECT_LIMIT characters.

For example:

  [DEV]: add the init command
  [BUGFIX]: keep the project id a rerun does not touch
  [REFACTO]: move the sync logic out of the command
