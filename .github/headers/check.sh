$missing of $checked source files are missing the license header.

Every source file carries it, in the comment syntax of its language: // for
Dart, # for shell. Copy the header from a neighbouring file of the same
language.

The header goes at the very top, except in a file that starts with a shebang,
where it goes on the line after it.
